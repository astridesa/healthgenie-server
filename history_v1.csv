From the perspective of modern nutrition, diet is not only about meeting energy needs but also an important way to regulate the body's condition. Based on your needs, I have recommended three dishes with diverse nutritional values. They are not only delicious but can also help improve overall health. Below is a detailed introduction:

### Spanish Potato Omelette
This classic Spanish dish uses potatoes, eggs, and onions as its main ingredients, rich in high-quality protein, dietary fiber, and various vitamins. Potatoes provide abundant potassium, which helps maintain cardiovascular health; the protein and lecithin in eggs enhance physical strength and brain function. Onions contain antioxidants that can help alleviate fatigue and improve skin condition.

**Preparation**:
1. Slice the potatoes and pan-fry them in olive oil until golden.
2. Add sliced onions and stir-fry, seasoning with a pinch of salt and black pepper.
3. Beat the eggs and pour them into the pan, cooking until the omelette sets.

This dish is suitable not only for breakfast but also as a lunch option to replenish energy, ease tension, and boost focus.

### Spanish Seafood Paella
This dish features shrimp, squid rings, and saffron, paired with short-grain rice and vegetables, offering rich nutrition and layered flavors. Seafood is rich in high-quality protein and omega-3 fatty acids, which help boost immunity and promote cardiovascular and brain health. Saffron imparts a unique aroma to the rice and contains antioxidants that help reduce inflammation.

**Preparation**:
1. Sauté onions and green peppers in olive oil, then add short-grain rice and stir-fry.
2. Pour in chicken broth, add saffron, shrimp, squid rings, and clams, and cook until the rice is fully cooked.
3. Finally, sprinkle green peas and season with a pinch of salt.

This dish not only replenishes energy but also helps improve digestion, making it an ideal main course for family gatherings.

### Greek Cucumber Yogurt Salad
This refreshing salad features cucumber and Greek yogurt, paired with lemon juice and dill, rich in vitamin C, dietary fiber, and probiotics. Cucumber helps cool the body and hydrate, while the probiotics in yogurt support gut health. Lemon juice provides antioxidant benefits.

**Preparation**:
1. Dice the cucumber and mix it with low-fat Greek yogurt.
2. Combine minced garlic, lemon juice, and fresh dill, seasoning with a pinch of sea salt and black pepper.
3. Stir well and refrigerate briefly before serving.

This salad pairs well with main dishes or can be enjoyed as a standalone light meal, especially suitable for hot weather to help cool down and replenish hydration.

With these three dishes, you can explore different flavors while consuming a variety of nutrients. Remember to maintain a balanced diet, including appropriate amounts of protein, carbohydrates, and healthy fats. If you have specific health concerns, it is recommended to consult a doctor or nutritionist for more tailored advice.
